//2026 Corvette ZR1 To Offer New High-Performance Brake Package

//ZR1

//The 2026 Corvette ZR1 is getting a serious braking upgrade! As part of the ZTK performance package, it features 10-piston front and 6-piston rear calipers, paired with massive carbon ceramic discs—the largest brake setup ever fitted to a production Corvette.
//These brakes are designed to handle the ZR1’s monStous 1,064-horsepower twin-turbo 5.5L V8 LT7 engine, ensuring it can stop as impressively as it accelerates. The ZTK package also includes Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires and a Carbon Fiber Aero package for maximum track performance.

//2026 ZR1 Corvette ZTK Will Have Some Of The Biggest Brakes Anywhere
//https://carbuzz.com/2026-zr1-corvette-ztk-big-brakes/

//Chevrolet says that the new brakes will be the largest ever fitted to a production Corvette. It didn't spell out exactly how sizable the rotors will be, but for comparison, the standard ZR1 has 15.7-inch front rotors and 15.4-inch rear rotors to stop it. Yes, they're already carbon, but the standard ZR1 has six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers, versus the 10-piston front and six-piston rear new ZTK parts. This new kit could make them some of the biggest automotive brakes in the world.

//Why carbon ceramic brakes? They don't corrode, for a start, so they'll always look good sitting inside the ZR1's available exposed carbon fiber wheels. But they also deliver benefits when it comes to stopping. Not just in braking distances, where their higher coefficient of friction can reduce distances significantly, because that is ultimately limited by the tire.

//Carbon ceramic brakes are nearly impervious to heat and thus fade. So they can handle lap after lap on even the toughest racetracks without overheating and either starting to fade, where the car fails to slow down as quickly when you ask, or cooking its parts to complete failure.

//Lastly, they last longer. In theory, they can last hundreds of thousands of miles if they don't have to endure a life of track time. They also can't warp or distort like iron rotors can.

// A set of sensors
// An electronic control unit (ECU) responsible for coordinating the entire system

// Dampers
// The MRC dampers are filled with magnetorheological fluid that is a mixture of easily-magnetized iron particles in a synthetic hydrocarbon oil. For the third generation of the technology, each monotube damper contains a piston with two electromagnetic coils and two small fluid passages through the piston. The electromagnets are capable of creating a variable magnetic field across the fluid passages.

//////////ZR1 turbos

// The 2025 Corvette ZR1 is equipped with dual 76mm turbochargers integrated with the exhaust manifold. These mono-scroll, ball-bearing turbos are designed for quick response and feature electronic wastegates to optimize performance. The ZR1's LT7 5.5L twin-turbo V8 produces 1,064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft of torque, making it the most powerful factory Corvette ever2.

// The 2025 Corvette ZR1 is equipped with BorgWarner twin turbochargers, designed specifically for the LT7 5.5L V8. These 76mm turbos feature electronically actuated wastegates and ball-bearing conStuction to optimize performance. BorgWarner has a long history of supplying high-performance components, including for IndyCar racing.
// Interestingly, each turbocharger carries a Gemini rocket insignia, paying homage to GM’s collaboration with NASA in the 1960s. You can explore more details on BorgWarner’s involvement here.
