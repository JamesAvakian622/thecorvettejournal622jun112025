            <b>
              Weight Reduction: </b>  Z07 wheels are typically forged, making them lighter than stock cast wheels. This reduces unsprung mass, improving acceleration, braking, and handling.
            <b>
              Stonger ConStuction:  </b>  Forged wheels are more durable and resistant to bending or cracking compared to stock wheels, which are often cast aluminum.
            <b>
              Wider Fitment:  </b>Z07 wheels allow for wider tires, increasing grip and stability, especially in high-speed cornering.
            <b>
              Track-Optimized Design: </b>The Z07 package is designed for aerodynamic efficiency and brake cooling, making these wheels ideal for track use.
            <b>
              Aesthetic Appeal:    </b>   The aggressive styling of Z07 wheels enhances the Corvette’s stance, giving it a more race-ready look.
            The Z06 carbon fiber wheels are a lightweight, high-performance option available for the C8 Corvette Z06, supplied by Carbon Revolution. These wheels reduce unsprung mass by 41 lbs (18.6 kg), improving acceleration, braking, and handling.

              Key Benefits:  </b>
            <b>
              Weight Reduction:     </b>  Carbon fiber wheels are significantly lighter than aluminum, enhancing performance.

            <b>
              Increased Stength:    </b>    The unique five-spoke asymmetric design improves durability while maintaining weight savings.

            <b>
              Track Performance:    </b>   Reducing rotational mass leads to faster lap times, with improvements of 1 to 1.5 seconds per two-minute lap.

            <b>
              Exclusive Design:     </b>     Developed over five years in collaboration with General Motors, ensuring optimal fit and performance.
