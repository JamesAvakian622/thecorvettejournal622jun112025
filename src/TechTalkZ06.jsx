          Launch Control: If you want to experience the full potential of your
          C8, learn how to use Launch Control. It helps you achieve optimal
          acceleration from a standstill by managing wheel spin and maximizing
          traction. Battery Maintenance: Keep a battery tender plugged in if you
          don't drive your C8 regularly. This helps maintain the battery's
          health and prevents it from draining. Battery, Three Years, Buy a
          Antigravity, Ten Year Battery Plus life plus options, "No More Dead
          Batteries", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTaRPv3g0o8&t=329s Fuel
          Storage: If you're storing your C8 for an extended period, keep the
          fuel tank full to prevent moisture from forming inside. Adding a fuel
          stabilizer can also help keep the gas fresh. Engine Priming: Before
          starting your C8 after winter storage, check the fluids and tire
          pressure. Priming the engine isn't necessary, but ensuring everything
          is in good condition is essential. Magnetic Ride Control: Familiarize
          yourself with the different driving modes (Tour, Sport, Track, and
          Weather) to optimize your driving experience based on the conditions
          and your preferences. Maintenance Schedule: Follow the maintenance
          schedule outlined in the owner's manual, especially for the
          Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). Regular oil changes and DCT
          maintenance are crucial for the car's longevity. Ceramic Coating:
          Consider applying a ceramic coating to protect your C8's paint and
          make it easier to clean. This can help preserve the car's appearance
          and reduce the need for frequent waxing. Interior Accessories: Invest
          in quality interior accessories like floor mats and trunk liners to
          protect the interior from wear and tear. Brands like WeatherTech offer
          durable options. Chrome your wheels, WheelCraft, tel PPF your
